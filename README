FormBuilder.js

Generates forms with *validation* from JSON fields using backbone.js, underscore.js, handlebars.js, and jQuery.

Current Issues/Todo:
While validation fields are built into the API the related events are not linked to the form Object because the form object has no validate method currently.

Templating is coupled to a Static Template Factory and template object.  These are easy to reimplement but I am going to decouple them using dependency injection via closures.
